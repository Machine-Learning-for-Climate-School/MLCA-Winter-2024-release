    "In this notebook you will work on time series analysis and forecasting, focusing on temperature registers from the Finnish Meteorological Institute's observation stations. There are several weather stations across Finland, you are asked to choose one, collect historical temperature data and perform a detailed time series analysis. After that you will develop two models for forecasting temperature time series: a baseline model and another employing the advanced Prophet model. You will then explore the urban heat island effect by comparing temperature data from urban and rural observation stations."

    "\n",
    "In this excercise you will analyze historical temperature data from a weather observation station in Finland to understand its temperature patterns, variability and trends. Data can be obtained from the [Finnish Meteorological Institute](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/download-observations).\n",

    "1. **Data loading:** Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame and parse the dates so you end up with two columns: `timestamp`, datetime object of the form `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` (as DataFrame index column), and `y`, the average hourly temperature.\n",
    "2. **Data check-up:** check for missing values in the dataset. Depending on the extent and nature of the missing data, you might choose to fill in missing values using methods like forward fill, backward fill, or interpolation. Alternatively, if the missing data is extensive or not randomly distributed, you might opt to remove those observations.\n",
    "5. **Initial exploration:** Plot the entire temperature time series to visualize any noticeable irregularities. Compute statistical summaries to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the temperature data. Justify your choices. Explain in your own words any obvious patterns, trends or anomalies that you see."

    "## **Exercise 5.5: Can you see the urban heat island effect?** (2 pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "In urban areas, surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain heat more than natural landscapes, leading to higher temperatures compared to surrounding rural areas. This phenomenon is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, and it is most noticeable during the night. In this exercise, you will investigate the UHI effect by comparing temperature data from two weather stations: one located within a city and another in a less urbanized area nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data selection:** Choose a second weather station that is close to your initially selected station but located in a more rural area or further away from the city center. Ensure that both stations have temperature data available for the same time period.\n",
    "2. **Data preparation:** Extract night-time temperature data for both stations, focusing specifically on the hours that are considered night-time. Given Finland's extreme variation in night-time length across seasons, you need to adjust the analysis for these variations. You will analyse summer and winter months separatly.\n",
    "   - **Summer analysis:** During summer months (June, July, August), night-time is very short or non-existent. Consider using the late evening hours (e.g., 10 PM to 2 AM) for analysis (you can adapt this), and justify your choices. This period can still reflect urban heat retention even during the shortest nights.\n",
    "   - **Winter analysis:** In winter (December, January, February), when nights are long, choose a consistent night-time window that reflects the coldest part of the night (e.g., 12 AM to 5 AM), when the UHI effect might be more pronounced due to prolonged darkness.\n",
    "3. **Data analysis:** Calculate the average night-time temperature for each day for both locations. Compare the daily average night-time temperatures between the two stations over a significant period to identify any consistent temperature differences.\n",
    "4. **Visualization:** Visualize the temperature differences between the urban and rural (or less urbanized) stations over time. Highlight any patterns or anomalies observed in the data, particularly those that might indicate the presence of the UHI effect.\n",
    "5. **Discussion:** Discuss your findings, focusing on whether the data supports the existence of the UHI effect in the selected location. Reflect on the potential factors contributing to the observed temperature differences, such as urban density, vegetation cover, or proximity to heat-generating sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark:** Finland’s geographical position leads to significant variations in day length throughout the year, which can influence the UHI effect. In summer, the almost continuous daylight in many parts of Finland means urban areas may not cool down as much during the night, potentially exaggerating the UHI effect. In contrast, during the long winter nights, differences in temperature between urban and rural areas might be influenced by factors like snow cover and heating practices. Considering these seasonal variations is essential for accurately assessing the UHI effect in your analysis."
